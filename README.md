This is intended as a playground for ECMAScript 6 Features.
Since ES6 modules are not supported in the browser yet, Rollup.js + Babel are used to bundle and transpile the code to ES5.

To get started:
npm install
npm run bundle
npm install -g serve
serve .
navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser, open developer console
